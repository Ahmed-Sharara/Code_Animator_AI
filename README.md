# Project Description: AlgoAnimator

Overview:
AlgoAnimator is an AI-powered platform that transforms complex programming algorithms and computer science topics into dynamic, animated presentations. By simply inputting a topic (e.g., "Dijkstra's algorithm," "neural networks," or "quicksort"), the system generates an engaging, step-by-step visual explanation complete with animations, pseudocode highlights, and real-time simulations. Designed for educators, students, and developers, it turns abstract concepts into intuitive visual stories.

## Key Features:

1. Smart Topic Parsing:

Accepts any algorithm or programming concept (e.g., recursion, machine learning models, data structures) and auto-generates structured content.
Breaks down topics into logical segments: problem context, algorithm workflow, complexity analysis, and real-world applications.

2. Dynamic Animations:

Visualizes algorithms in action (e.g., sorting arrays with color-coded swaps, traversing graphs with moving nodes).
Syncs animations with narrated explanations to clarify each step.

3. Adaptive Difficulty:

Adjusts depth based on audience expertise (beginner to advanced).
Offers interactive layers: toggle code annotations, math proofs, or optimization trade-offs.

4. Export-Ready Outputs:

Generates shareable videos, slide decks, or embeddable web modules.
Supports integrations (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, LMS platforms like Moodle).
